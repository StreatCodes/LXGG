## LXGG

LXGG is linux containers made easy. LXGG is just a web interface to quickly create, manage and destroy linux containers without having to fiddle with LXC commands. The best part about LXGG is how easy it is to setup, the package `apt install lxgg` (soon..) then goto `localhost:9871` in your web browser to start managing your hosts!

### TODO
 - Make LXGG web api with JWT auth.
 - VueJS front end with native CSS grid.
 - Translate LXGG API calls into LXD calls.
 - Create packages for major package managers.
 - World domination.
